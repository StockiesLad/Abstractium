# Description
Abstractium is a moderately simple mod that provides tools to abstract interactive code between a mod and 
given dependency. It was made as a personal api that I can use to make my mods support multiple versions 
simultaneously by abstracting calls to minecraft code.

# Structure/Progress
Currently, as of 8/31/2023, the api is going to standalone; containing no embedded abstractions or wrapped
code.

There are plans to create a solid foundation for a bunch of abstractions for mods to use, starting with a
registration api. Then old code will be wrapped, using the abstractions to ensure compatibility.

Now here's an important thing to keep in mind, please don't get too excited and think this is the
beginning of some revolutionary api that'll let you play mods from 1.7.10 all the way to the latest version.
My time is limited, people have a habit of taking more than they give when it comes to things like this and
for the foreseeable future it will remain in the state it is now unless people contribute.
